# Website_Blog_Codesets
Codesets used for posts on cafltar.org/blog written by Eric Russell

Each folder contains the draft form (pre-upload) of the post along with the code and data used to generate the figures.

The ClimoDays folder contains multiple posts about the climate of individual days of interest across the year
Cold_As_Ice notes the timeframe of the first freeze based off the max and min temperatures for the city
PrecipEvents is about an extreme precipitation even that occurred in Pullman in April 2019 and the historical context of April precipitation
PleasantDays is a dive into counting the amount of pleasant weather days in Pullman and how this has changed over the last 50-75 years based on data availibility.

Each folder is relatively self-contained for each project and data/set. Each code-set was built specifically for each project for function over form. Comments and updates to code will occur...slowly.

Discrepancies in figures due to updates to datasets as code was updated and cleaned up to be added to this repo.
